Championship Hunt Heats Up,"September 24, 2018","
It was déjà vu in Virginia as Toyota NASCAR drivers Kyle Busch and Christopher Bell swept both of this year’s race weekends at Richmond Raceway. Camry driver Tyler Ankrum clinched the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East (NKNPSE) championship and Logan Seavey extended his USAC points lead. Toyota NHRA drivers are also within striking distance of the championship.


Camry driver Busch came from the rear of the field in Saturday night’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (MENCS) race to lead 92 laps (of 400) en route to victory lane. The win – which was his 50th career (and 46th in a Toyota) – automatically advances him to the Round of 12 set to commence at Dover International Speedway in two weeks.

“Yeah, I'm not going to qualify here anymore,” Busch joked of starting deep in the field for both of this year’s Richmond races. “It’s a waste of time for us. I don’t know why, I just cannot qualify here, but we’ve got a really good race car when it comes time to have a race and especially the later it gets. This M&M’s Toyota Camry was awesome tonight. I can’t thank Adam Stevens (crew chief) and all my guys enough. Great job at working on this thing and getting it put back together today and being able to get it ready for tonight to be a great race car.”

Toyota driver Martin Truex Jr. finished third Saturday – his 17th top-10 this season – and also advances to the next round. Playoff contenders Erik Jones (11th) and Denny Hamlin (16th) earned top-20 finishes at Richmond, but are on the bubble as the series heads to this weekend’s cutoff race at Charlotte’s new Roval track.

Bell went two for two at Richmond this season, winning Friday night’s NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) race. He started from the pole position and led 67 laps (of 250) before taking the checkered flag – a victory that propels him to the second playoff round, which begins at Kansas next month.

“I’ll tell you what, that’s pretty cool,” Bell said. “It’s not very often that you get to win with a car that’s not a winning car, so we’ll take it. Just thank you to my pit crew for the awesome pit stops tonight. Jason Ratcliff (crew chief) did a great job making this thing better each and every time we hit pit road. Man, I'm just pumped. To be able to sweep Richmond and to get five wins on top of that just couldn’t be happier.”

Toyota driver Ankrum clinched the NASCAR East championship with a 13th-place finish at New Hampshire Motor Speedway Saturday. The 17-year-old, California-native clinched the championship behind the strength of four victories and 12 top-10 finishes in 13 races so far this season.


J.R. Todd extended his consecutive round win streak to 10 before eventually falling to Tim Wilkerson in the semifinals at Gateway Motorsports Park. Todd sits second in the Countdown to the Championship playoffs after two of six races, just 30 points out of the lead.

In Top Fuel, Antron Brown advanced to the second round and remains fifth in the point standings.


Logan Seavey charged from 13th to third to lead Toyota at the USAC P1 Insurance National Midget series’ event at Ohio’s Eldora Speedway. Seavey extended his USAC championship lead to 118 points over fellow Toyota driver Brady Bacon with just three races remaining.


NASCAR takes on the new road course at Charlotte Motor Speedway where the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series championship field will be cut from 16 to 12 on Sunday, September 30 at 2:00 p.m. ET on NBC. NASCAR Xfinity Series also races on the Roval on September 29 at 3:00 p.m. ET on NBCSN.

NASCAR K&N Pro Series West heads to Idaho’s Meridian Speedway Saturday, with the race broadcast on October 5 at 1:00 p.m. ET.

Toyota Drivers Battle at Bristol and Brainerd,"August 20, 2018","
Toyota drivers captured victories in ARCA and POWRi competition over the weekend, while battles took place in NASCAR at the Bristol Motor Speedway short track and the Countdown to the Championship picture continued to take formation as NHRA competed in Brainerd, Minnesota.


Short track racing was on full display on Saturday as the Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (MENCS) took to Bristol Motor Speedway. Camry driver Erik Jones was the highest-finishing Toyota driver as the No. 20 Camry finished fifth.

For Jones, the fifth-place showing was his third top-five finish in his last four races.

“We were a little bit tight on the short run,” said Jones. “It was good on the long run – about 80, 60 laps in we were pretty good, but just didn’t have enough. It felt like we were having to hustle really hard all night – harder than you really should to be good here. The Sport Clips Camry was alright. We got up there and contended for a bit. Restarted second, that’s all you can ask for – having a shot. Just didn’t have enough. This is a good day for us. Bristol is a good spot for us and happy to run in the top five, but obviously want to go and contend for the win.”

Toyota driver Kyle Busch started in the third position, but an accident on lap two sent him two laps down. Busch fought through the field to break into the top two in the night’s final stage, but finished 20th.

“That was just me and this team and never giving up and being able to drive up through the field like that,” said Busch. “This M&M’s Camry was fast, even torn up and wrecked and everything else, it was fast.”

In Friday night’s NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) race, Christopher Bell finished in the runner-up spot after battling with fellow dirt-track racer Kyle Larson. Bell led a total of 18 laps (of 310) at the half-mile short track.

“I thought we had a shot at him if it stayed green,” said Bell. “Heck, even with the yellow, I thought we were still going to have a shot at him, but that second to last run when I was leading some laps – me and Kyle (Larson) were really equal, I told my crew chief Jason (Ratcliff) that I couldn’t afford to be any looser and he tightened up for the last run and just tightening it up and restarting on the bottom and then lost track position. I just couldn’t ever get back up there to challenge him. I wasn’t good enough to pass those guys. We got a couple bad restart lines which put us back in the field, but the most important one there on the green-white-checker, we got the right restart line so that’s all that matters.”

The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) completed their regular season during Thursday night’s race at Bristol Motor Speedway. As the series prepares to start their Playoffs next weekend at Canada’s Canadian Tire Motorsport Park, two Toyota Tundra drivers in Noah Gragson and Brett Moffitt will be among the eight contending for this year’s championship.

For Gragson, it will be his first time in the NCWTS Playoffs. He is excited about all of the Playoffs tracks on the schedule.

“I feel like we’ll be good at the road course, Canada,” said Gragson. “I feel really confident about the selection of tracks within the playoffs. You have the road course, which I feel really confident about – finished second there last year – Talladega, that’s kind of a wild card. We got Vegas, that’s my hometown, so that’s a really good one and then the three after that – Martinsville, Texas, Phoenix – I’m really pumped up. We sat on the pole at Texas, almost won last year and Phoenix and won last year at Martinsville. Just got to keep on working hard to get to Homestead and really excited for the tracks coming up.”


Toyota driver Antron Brown advanced to the Top Fuel finals before falling to Billy Torrence on a hole-shot at the Lucas Oil NHRA Nationals at Brainerd International Raceway. It marked the third final round appearance for Brown in the last five events.

J.R. Todd drove his DHL Toyota Camry to the Funny Car semifinals. Brown and Todd clinched their berths in NHRA’s Countdown to the Championship this weekend, joining the previously qualified Doug Kalitta.


Toyota driver Christian Eckes won the ARCA race at one of two dirt tracks the series competes on annually in Springfield, Illinois.

The win was Eckes second ARCA Racing Series win of 2018 – having won at Salem earlier this season.

Through 15 ARCA Series races this season, Toyota drivers have come away victorious in 14 of them.


Kevin Thomas Jr. won Saturday night’s POWRi Lucas Oil National Midget League feature at Macon Speedway. The win was the third for Thomas Jr. with Toyota power this season and the fourth for Petry Motorsports, which also captured a second podium finish with Jerry Coons, Jr., who placed third.

Zach Daum took the win in Sunday night’s race in Wisconsin. He led Tucker Klaasmeyer and Jason McDougal across the finish line in a Toyota one-two-three finish at Angell Park Speedway.

Overall, it was the 29th and 30th national midget feature win for a Toyota-powered driver in 2018.


3GT Racing drivers Dominik Baumann and Kyle Marcelli claimed their second victory of the season in the No. 14 Lexus RC F GT3 in Sunday’s race at Virginia International Raceway (VIR) in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship GTD class. The team previously earned their first class win at Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course in May, marking the first North American victory for the Lexus RC F GT3.

“It’s just a great feeling,” said Dominik Baumann. “It’s the first year for me in IMSA with the team and everything. All of the tracks are new for me so it’s always a new challenge going to all of the race tracks and learning them from the first practice on every week. Just a great feeling to win today. It was a good day.”


The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series is off this weekend for the final time this season. The NASCAR Xfinity Series heads to Road America for a Saturday showdown on August 25 at 3 p.m. ET on NBCSN. The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series heads to Canadian Tire Motorsport Park for its first Playoff contest of the year. The Trucks are slated to race on Sunday, August 26 at 2:30 p.m. ET on FS1.

The NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and West series’ combine for a race on Friday, August 24 at Gateway Motorsports Park. The race will air tape-delayed on Thursday, August 30 at 6 p.m. ET on NBCSN.

The ARCA Racing Series is in action on Saturday, August 25 at 3 p.m. ET on MAVTV at Berlin Raceway.

2018 Toyota Prius Remains A Hybrid Benchmark,"August 08, 2018","
Around the world, its name is synonymous with “hybrid.” Almost two decades after the first Toyota Prius was introduced in the U.S., hybridization has become common, and the Prius still leads in North American hybrid sales. It’s also one of the world’s most fuel-efficient vehicles without a plug, with EPA-estimated 58 city / 53 highway / 56 combined MPG fuel economy ratings (Prius Two Eco).

For the 2018 model year, Prius Four and Four Touring grades receive a new standard 11.6-inch high-definition multimedia display. The tablet-like operation of the vertically-oriented screen provides drivers with easy access to major functions and allows navigation graphics to be brightly visible. Drivers and front passengers will find the pinch and zoom functionality familiar, speaking to the enhanced premium touch that the screen brings to these grades.

Toyota offers the 2018 Prius in seven model grades, each one equipped as standard with Toyota Safety Sense P (TSS-P). Using millimeter-wave radar and a monocular camera sensor to help detect a pedestrian, a vehicle, and lane markers in the surrounding area, TSS-P provides a comprehensive bundle of active safety features designed to help protect drivers and passengers from harm and includes: Pre-Collision System with Pedestrian Detection (PCS w/ PD), Lane Departure Alert with Steering Assist (LDA w/ SA), Automatic High Beams (AHB), and Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control (DRCC).

An available Prius Appearance Package adds additional flair with two-tone black and gunmetal front and rear bumpers, piano black side skirt rocker panels, and 17-inch 5-spoke alloy wheels with gunmetal inserts on the Three and Four Touring grades.

Common among all Prius models is a premium interior with a wrap-around dash design, form-hugging seats, easy-to-use controls and exemplary visibility. With up to 65.5 cubic feet of cargo space, Prius provides flexibility in the gear on board. Whether it’s farmer’s market finds, sports gear or supermarket hauls, Prius has it covered.



Every generation of the Prius has one key element in common: it exceeded the fuel efficiency of the previous generation. The latest version of its Hybrid Synergy Drive combines the output of a 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine and two motor/generators through an electronically controlled planetary-type continuously variable transmission (CVT). Shift-by-wire technology, which uses electric signals to transmit shift operations, offers light, fingertip operation from the dash-mounted shifter. The regenerative brake system switches the motor into a generator to recover the wheels’ kinetic energy as electrical power, storing it in the hybrid battery.

The fourth-generation Prius uses smaller, lighter hybrid components than before, including a lithium-ion hybrid battery that replaced the nickel-metal hydride battery (excluding the Prius One and Two standard grade). The battery’s smaller size and lower profile allow it to be packaged under the rear seat, rather than beneath the luggage area, yielding more cargo space. The Prius Two Eco grade provides the highest fuel efficiency thanks to its lighter weight and further optimized aerodynamics.



The electric motors and battery don’t get all the credit for the high fuel economy in the Prius. The internal combustion engine (I.C.E.) does its part, too. The 2ZR-FXE 1.8-liter 4-cylinder gasoline engine achieves more than 40 percent thermal efficiency, thanks to reduced internal friction and improved combustion. It’s also quieter than the previous generation’s engine. Toyota found extra efficiency by cooling the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system, and by using exhaust heat recirculation to quickly bring engine coolant up to optimal temperature.

Because the Prius, under certain circumstances, can operate in battery mode alone, it incorporates a Vehicle Proximity Notification System (VPNS) to help alert pedestrians and cyclists. A small in-vehicle speaker emits a low but noticeable warning tone when traveling below approximately 15 mph, and the sound changes with vehicle speed.



The newest-generation Prius cheats the wind without cheating passengers out of room. The vehicle’s sleek body yields a 0.24 coefficient of drag (Cd), among the lowest of current production passenger cars. Aerodynamic efficiency is supported by such details as an automatic grille shutter that reduces drag by closing when airflow to the radiator is not needed. Aero stabilizing fins on the underfloor covers, front quarter window garnish and tail lamps likewise keep air moving in a smooth pattern.



Prius lighting is as advanced as it looks. Standard Bi-LED headlamps dominate the striking front fascia, and the rear combination lamps echo the design theme.

Seeing out of the Prius is easier than ever, too. The design gives a clear view to the rear, thanks to larger rear door glass and larger fixed rear quarter windows. A backup camera comes standard on all grades, and, as on the previous model, a full-width glass panel beneath the rear spoiler aids rearward visibility.



Beneath the Prius’ dramatic bodylines is the solid foundation of Toyota’s New Global Architecture (TNGA). In this current-generation Prius, the platform introduced a new high-strength body structure, double-wishbone style multi-link rear suspension and a lower center of gravity. All combine to yield a highly engaging driving experience while also providing a markedly smoother and quieter ride than the previous generation. The gasoline engine, electric motor and seating positions are lower than in previous models to increase front and rear head room while at the same time achieving a low, aerodynamic stance.

The TNGA platform’s structural strength greatly contributes to the high level of handling responsiveness, steering feel and ride quality in the Prius. Hot-stamped and high tensile steels, which allow for intricate forms that are both lightweight and strong, are used extensively throughout the body. Aluminum components, including the hood and rear doorframes and brake calipers, help keep vehicle weight in check. Innovative fastening methods, including laser screw welding and advanced adhesives, contribute to structural strength.



A double-wishbone style multi-link rear suspension, seen on some of the world’s best sport sedans, is also under the Prius. As in those cars, this configuration endows the Prius with outstanding ride quality and handling agility. The design also maximizes trunk space.

The Prius Touring grades take full advantage of the suspension’s inherent handling benefits by using special tuning and 17-inch wheels with 215/45R17 tires. On other grades, light-alloy 15 x 6.5-inch wheels wear aerodynamic wheel covers to reduce drag and wind noise. On all Prius models, low-rolling resistance tires are optimized for grip.

Step on the brake pedal in the Prius, and instead of a cable, foot pressure signals the Electronically Controlled Brake System to apply appropriate braking force through the active hydraulic brake booster. The system coordinates control between the hybrid system’s regenerative braking and the hydraulic brake force to provide optimal performance and feel.



Inside the Prius, the intuitive concept of previous models continues, anchored by a central gauge panel. The panel features dual 4.2-inch full-color TFT (Thin Film Transistor) multi-information displays, and their content can be changed using steering wheel controls. The display background color changes depending on the selected drive mode. With Power mode selected, the background appropriately glows red. Choosing Normal mode brings on a soothing blue glow.

The display provides a multitude of readouts for hybrid energy information and much more, and the driver can choose how much information to receive by selecting either Simple or Segmented display modes. Simple mode shows a large vehicle speed display, remaining fuel, drive mode indicator, outside temperature, odometer functions and cruising range. The Segmented display presents more detail about hybrid operation, including instantaneous fuel economy, hybrid battery state of charge and a suite of ECO functions to encourage efficient driving habits.

A driving support display shows the status of features such as Full-Speed Range Dynamic Radar Cruise Control, Lane Departure Alert and other systems.



The Prius’ hybrid powertrain runs very quietly, and aerodynamic design blunts wind noise. A sound-insulating laminated windshield and numerous sound absorbers in the dash structure reduce noise intrusion. Higher-grade models feature sound-insulating laminated front door glass, as well. The carpeting is backed by a thick silencer pad, and a urethane-based headliner, along with the ribbed structure of the front pillar trim, helps absorb sound.



Depending on model grade, the tilt and telescoping steering wheel comes wrapped in urethane or SofTex synthetic leather that features surface temperature-regulating properties to make it feel more comfortable in hot or cold weather. Even the air conditioning system, which uses a quiet electric compressor, works intelligently. The Smart-flow (S-FLOW) mode directs airflow only to seated occupants to conserve energy and maximize comfort.

In the Prius Two Eco grade, heat-insulating IR-cut windshield glass substantially reduces the transmission of infrared rays, enhancing interior comfort and also reducing the air conditioning system’s workload. In cold weather, a ceramic-type heater warms the cabin quickly.



The Prius is all high-tech inside, as well, connecting with devices and music through its Entune Audio systems. Wireless charging (except base Prius One, Two, and Two Eco grades) works with Qi-compatible phones or other devices.

The standard Entune Audio system on the Prius One, Prius Two, and Prius Two Eco grades includes the Entune Multimedia Bundle with a 6.1-inch touch-screen display, AM/FM CD player, six speakers, auxiliary audio jack, USB 2.0 port with iPod connectivity and control, advanced voice recognition, hands-free phone capability, phone book access and music streaming via Bluetooth wireless technology, plus Siri Eyes Free mode and an integrated backup camera display.

Moving up to the Prius Three and Prius Three Touring grades, customers will enjoy Entune Premium Audio with Integrated Navigation and Entune App Suite, which includes all the previously-mentioned audio features plus a 7-inch high resolution touch-screen with split screen display, Entune App Suite, HD radio, HD predictive traffic and doppler weather overlay, AM/FM cache radio, SiriusXM All Access Radio with 3-month complimentary trial and Gracenote album cover art.

Taking the multimedia experience to a premium one, the Prius Four and Prius Four Touring grades come standard with an 11.6-inch high-resolution, vertically-oriented screen that operates similarly to other touchscreen mobile devices and tablets.

As part of a package, the Prius Four and Four Touring grades exclusively offer the Entune Premium JBL Audio system with Integrated Navigation and App Suite. To all features of the base and mid-grade systems, it adds 10 JBL GreenEdge Speakers in six locations creating a personal concert hall on wheels.

The Entune App Suite includes Destination Search, iHeartRadio, MovieTickets.com, OpenTable, Pandora, Facebook Places, Yelp and Slacker Radio plus real-time info including traffic, weather, fuel prices, sports and stocks. Access to Entune App Suite is subscription free. (See toyota.com/entune for details.)



The Prius can even help park itself. When activated, available Intelligent Parking Assist (IPA) uses ultrasonic wave sensors to automatically steer the Prius into – or out from – parallel parking spaces, or reverse it into a perpendicular space. The Toyota-first Intelligent Clearance Sonar provides visible and audible warnings if the driver gets too close to detected obstacles on the vehicle’s sides – an excellent tool for navigating tight parking garages, for example.

A full array of supplemental restraint system (SRS) airbags includes a driver and front passenger Advanced Airbag System; driver and front passenger side airbags; front and rear curtain airbags; a driver knee airbag, and a front passenger seat cushion airbag.



Toyota’s 36-month/36,000 mile basic new-vehicle warranty applies to all components other than normal wear and maintenance items. Additional 60-month warranties cover the powertrain for 60,000 miles and against corrosion with no mileage limitation. The hybrid-related components, including the HV battery, battery control module, hybrid control module and inverter with converter, are covered for eight years/100,000 miles.

The Prius also comes standard with ToyotaCare, a complimentary plan covering normal factory-scheduled maintenance for two years or 25,000 miles, whichever comes first. And, exclusive for Prius, three years (over the normal two) of 24-hour roadside assistance.

SBP Applies Toyota Training to Aid More Than 21 Nonprofits,"August 21, 2018","
Just one day after Hurricane Harvey hit Southeast Texas on Aug. 25, 2017, Toyota pledged $1 million to its long-time nonprofit partner SBP (formerly known as St. Bernard Project) to bring much-needed services to the community. Toyota has supported SBP since it began working to help families rebuild their homes in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina. The nonprofit Toyota Production System Support Center (TSSC) has helped SBP make its operations more efficient by applying the principles from the Toyota Production System. With Toyota’s assistance, SBP has reduced the number of days it takes to build a house to 60 from 112.

What’s more, SBP has used TPS to train more than 21 nonprofits to be more efficient and effective in their work to help families recover in Southeast Texas. Improving the quality of life in the communities in which we do business is a major goal of Toyota’s philanthropy.

Driving the Future – Toyota Team Members Get Connected,"August 22, 2018","
The University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and Toyota Motor North America Research & Development (TMNA R&D) welcome Toyota team members and their families as they “Get Connected” in the Ann Arbor Connected Vehicle Test Environment (AACVTE). The AACVTE is the world’s largest connected vehicle test environment for the DSRC 5.9GHz V2X technology and operates throughout the city of Ann Arbor.  Led by UMTRI and its partners, the AACVTE builds on the existing deployment, established in 2012.

Earlier this year, Toyota and Lexus announced plans to deploy Dedicated Short-Range Communications (DSRC) systems on vehicles sold in the U.S. starting in 2021.  And today, Toyota began inviting its over 1,800 R&D team members and their families who live and work in Washtenaw County to have their vehicles equipped with the latest DSRC 5.9GHz V2X technology connected vehicle systems.

“We believe this represents a significant step forward in creating a safer and more efficient driving ecosystem while advancing connected and automated technology,” said Wayne Powell, Vice President Electronics Systems at Toyota Motor North America.

With Toyota’s support, the AACVTE will remain the flagship for connected vehicle and infrastructure deployment and research in the world.

Connected vehicle safety technology (DSRC 5.9GHz V2X) allows vehicles to communicate wirelessly with other similarly equipped vehicles, and to communicate wirelessly with the infrastructure.

“Ann Arbor is an international hub for connected vehicle technology and research and it has everything to do with the community,” said James R. Sayer, director UMTRI. “This deployment allows us to gather data critical to advancing transportation safety.  A fully operational deployment enables UMTRI to conduct $3-5M in research a year, making it a significant living laboratory.”

To date, $50M has been invested in connected vehicles and infrastructure in Ann Arbor, beginning with the $30M Safety Pilot DSRC 5.9GHz V2X technology Model Deployment, launched in 2012 by UMTRI and the U.S. DOT.  AACVTE funding partners include the U-M (UMTRI, Mcity), the Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC), the City of Ann Arbor and other program partners and suppliers.

In addition to Toyota employees, UMTRI invites all community members to Get Connected!

Toyota aims to create a more inclusive society via Tokyo 2020,"August 24, 2018","
– As a worldwide partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, Toyota Motor Corporation is supporting Para sports and contributing to creating a more inclusive society at the grassroots level, as well as through cooperation with The Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee) and the broader business community in Japan. During the upcoming Paralympic Games, Toyota will encourage further interest in Para sports around the world while providing “Mobility for All” solutions.

Speaking on Toyota’s focus on the Paralympics, Akio Toyoda, President of Toyota Motor Corporation, said, “Through my meetings with Sir Philip Craven when he was President of the International Paralympic Committee in 2015, and with many Para athletes since, I have become even more committed to the idea that Toyota should provide mobility solutions for all people. With this in mind, we are taking steps as a mobility company, not just by making ‘ever-better cars’, but also by aiming to address various mobility needs above and beyond cars.”

He continued, “I am convinced this journey will help us appreciate differences as individuality, and lead us to free ourselves from the sort of fixed thinking that can hold back large organizations like ours, and from
and discrimination in society at large. I see Toyota’s involvement with the Paralympic movement as taking a decisive step toward our goal of ‘One Toyota’ and as a humble step to help achieve Sir Philip’s motto, ‘One World, One Dream, One People.’”

“Toyota’s aim of ‘Mobility for All’ is not just for those with impairments, but has broader implications for all people, and therefore has special meaning,” said Sir Philip Craven, a member of Toyota Motor Corporation’s board of directors since June 2018. “The first time Akio Toyoda visited the IPC headquarters a few years back, he recorded ‘Fight for the Future. One World, One Dream, One People, One Toyota.’ in our guestbook, and that left a strong impression on me. I came to believe that fighting together with Toyota may truly lead to a better future where all people will be able to have the freedom to move.”

Toyota is supporting the Paralympic movement through internal activities involving its employees, and by working in partnership with Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee and the All Japan Business Committee.


In 2017, Toyota began grassroots activities around the world related to expanding interest in Para sports, including:

When signing the agreement to become worldwide partner of the IPC, Toyota also signed an agreement to become a partner to approximately 180 local National Paralympic Committees (NPCs). Working closely with each NPC, Toyota aims to increase and develop interest in Para sports globally.







Toyota is engaged in activities with various stakeholders and local communities in Japan to support the movement of people with limited transportation options.

(Joint verification project in Akita Prefecture, Yokota City)



As worldwide partner of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, in addition to the mobility solutions that it will provide to the Games, Toyota will also work with its dealers, group companies and Tokyo 2020 Organizing Committee, the Japanese government and the city of Tokyo in the following ways:






To support the Games, the business community in Japan created the ""All Japan Business Committee"" with the objective of creating legacy for Tokyo 2020 and the future after the Games. The group is the coming together of three Japan economic/business organizations: the Japan Business Federation, the Japan Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Japan Association of Corporate Executives. Akio Toyoda is supporting the effort by chairing the Committee which is encouraging the participation of companies large and small nationwide in cooperation with state and local governments and civil society.

16-Year-Old Takes Weekend Spotlight,"August 27, 2018","
While the NASCAR Cup Series enjoyed a rare weekend off, other stock-car racing was in action in Canada as well as the Midwest. Near St. Louis, 16-year-old Derek Kraus shined in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and West combination event.


Road Racing took center stage once again for the NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) as Australian James Davison climbed into the No. 18 Joe Gibbs Racing Camry and earned an eighth-place finish at Wisconsin’s Road America on Saturday. Fellow Camry driver Brandon Jones also netted a ninth-place result at the four-mile road course, which was won by Justin Allgaier.

The NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) kicked-off their playoffs on Sunday, also with a road course event in Canada. The final lap was a show-stopper, which saw Brett Moffitt as the highest-finishing Toyota driver in third-place behind race-winner Justin Haley.

“Our race strategy we went for stage points,” said Moffitt. “We had a really fast Toyota Tundra today and these guys worked really hard on it. We had the speed where if we got to the front, we could pull away and go for a win. It just wasn’t our day, but overall a great points day.”

Championship contender Noah Gragson (ninth) paced a race-high 35 laps (of 65) after winning both of the event’s stages. His Kyle Busch Motorsports teammate Todd Gilliland also led 11 laps, including leading the field on the final lap. Gragson and Gilliland were fighting for the lead on the final corner where they made contact and both dropped out of contention. Gilliland would finish the day in 11th.

Meanwhile, the NASCAR K&N Pro Series East and West joined forces for the second combination event of the year, this time at Gateway Motorsports Park outside of St. Louis. Toyota driver Kraus led the final 37 laps (of 120) to earn the biggest victory of his career, which now includes four K&N Pro Series trophies.

“Our NAPA Toyota was really strong,” Kraus said. “It was a big win, with it being an East-West combo event and the first race at Gateway. That gives us bragging rights.”

Five Toyota drivers finished in the top-six positions with Kraus’ Bill McAnally Racing teammate Cole Rouse taking second – after leading 35 laps – followed by Ruben Garcia (fourth), Chase Cabre (fifth) and East points leader Tyler Ankrum in sixth.


Toyota driver Zane Smith finished runner-up in the ARCA Racing Series event a Michigan’s Berlin Raceway. Smith had been leading when eventual race winner Joe Graf made contact with Smith en route to the checkered flag.


The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series returns to action for a Throwback weekend at South Carolina’s Darlington Raceway on September 2 at 6 p.m. ET on NBCSN. NASCAR Xfinity Series will take on the ‘Lady in Black’ at Darlington on September 1 at 3:30 p.m. ET on NBC.

The NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series heads to Indianapolis for the U.S. Nationals -- the final race before their Countdown to the Championship begins. Broadcasts are set for September 2 at 4 p.m. ET and September 3 at 11 a.m. ET on FS1.

ARCA will compete at DiQuoin (Illinois) State Fairgrounds September 3 at 3 p.m. ET on MAVTV.

The Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series Midwest will conclude their season at the 49th annual off-road event at Crandon International Raceway.

Toyota and Uber Extend Collaboration to Automated Vehicle Technologies,"August 27, 2018","
Toyota Motor Corporation (TMC) and Uber Technologies, Inc. (Uber) today announced that they have agreed to expand their collaboration with the aim of advancing and bringing to market autonomous ride-sharing as a mobility service at scale. To accomplish this, technology from each company will be integrated into purpose-built Toyota vehicles to be deployed on Uber’s ride-sharing network.

Separately, Toyota is investing $500 million in Uber.

“Combining efforts with Uber, one of the predominant global ride-sharing and automated driving R&D companies, could further advance future mobility,” said Shigeki Tomoyama, executive vice president, TMC, and president, Toyota Connected Company. “This agreement and investment marks an important milestone in our transformation to a mobility company as we help provide a path for safe and secure expansion of mobility services like ride-sharing that includes Toyota vehicles and technologies.”

As Uber and Toyota look ahead to a self-driving future, this partnership will be critical in realizing self-driving technology at scale. Uber and Toyota anticipate that the mass-produced autonomous vehicles will be owned and operated by mutually agreed upon third party autonomous fleet operators.

“The deal is the first of its kind for Uber, and signals our commitment to bringing world-class technologies to the Uber network,” said Dara Khosrowshahi, Uber’s CEO. “Our goal is to deploy the world’s safest self-driving cars on the Uber network, and this agreement is another significant step towards making that a reality. Uber’s advanced technology and Toyota’s commitment to safety and its renowned manufacturing prowess make this partnership a natural fit. I look forward to seeing what our teams accomplish together.”

The initial “Autono-MaaS” (autonomous-mobility as a service) fleet will be based on Toyota’s Sienna Minivan platform. Uber’s Autonomous Driving System and the Toyota Guardian automated safety support system will both be integrated into the Autono-MaaS vehicles. Toyota will also utilize its Mobility Services Platform (MSPF), its core information infrastructure for connected vehicles. Pilot-scale deployments will begin on the Uber ride-sharing network in 2021.

“Uber’s automated driving system and Toyota’s Guardian system will independently monitor the vehicle environment and real-time situation, enhancing overall vehicle safety for both the automated driver and the vehicle,” said Dr. Gill Pratt, Toyota Research Institute CEO and TMC Fellow. “We look forward to this partnership accelerating both companies’ development and deployment of automated driving technology.”

Toyota’s investment in Uber and the proposed collaboration are subject to standard regulatory approvals.

Toyota is on the Road for Another Summer Music Spectacular at the Second Edition of the Los Dells Festival,"August 31, 2018","
Coined as the largest Latin music festival in the Midwest featuring a lineup of multi-genre artists, Los Dells Festival returns to the Wisconsin Dells on September 1st and 2nd.  Joining the music-filled weekend, Toyota presents the Toyota Music Den stage with a variety of Latin acts sure to delight music enthusiasts.

This year, Toyota—in collaboration with Sony Music—partnered with headlining Latin singer, songwriter, and producer Wisin as the curator of the Toyota Music Den stage. The lineup features the hottest Latin talent—in support of music discovery and Toyota’s commitment to supporting artists on their road to success.

“Toyota is all about creating experiences that engage artists and guests alike in the spirit of music discovery,” said Tyler McBride, Toyota’s engagement marketing manager. “To be able to collaborate with Sony Music and a music icon like Wisin sets up our Toyota Music Den for a spectacular debut at Los Dells.”

The Toyota
interactive area at Los Dells will feature numerous activities, including vehicle activations that bring music to life.  Within this setting, the Toyota Music Den presents a variety of musical performances featuring some of today’s most notable Latin artists.  The lineup includes:

“As a producer and artist, I enjoy working with young talent and helping to pave the way for them.  Being the curator of the Toyota Music Den provided me the opportunity to do that,” stated Wisin. “It’s exciting to be at Los Dells as a headliner and to be sharing the weekend with amazing artists.  Thanks to Toyota for having the vision to provide a stage for these young artists at important festivals like this one, bringing them that much closer to their fans.”

“What better place to showcase the latest artists, sounds, and trends than through these types of partnerships. Along with Wisin, a music icon who has written and produced countless award-winning records who knows what it takes and has an eye for talent,” said Cebele Marquez, Sony Music US Latin’s senior director of business development.

In addition to continuing its support for music through festival involvement, Toyota announced its fourth-year partnership with the VH1 Save The Music Foundation in support of music education.  The interactive campaign encourages musicians and fans to express their support and share what music means to them through social media using #ToyotaGiving.

Toyota and VH1 Save The Music have presented grants to various deserving schools in Chicago, Las Vegas and New Orleans to date.  Toyota will make its largest donation yet to VH1 Save The Music this year, $50,000 which will fund a Music Technology grant to support a school in the Philadelphia School District, as well as a $7,500 music grant to the Miami-Dade School District.

Holiday Weekend Nets Winning Results,"September 04, 2018","
What better way for a racer to close out the summer than with a trip to victory lane – or bring home a championship – and that’s exactly how Toyota drivers celebrated Labor Day weekend. In total, five triumphs were collected across NHRA, ARCA, POWRi and the first championship of the year won by a Toyota driver in off-road racing.


Three Toyota Camry drivers collected top-10 finishes at South Carolina’s Darlington Raceway with Kyle Busch the top-Toyota finisher in seventh in the Southern 500 on Sunday. Erik Jones finished eighth, his 13th top-10 in his sophomore season.

“We had a really good car,” Jones said. “The Sport Clips Camry was good. You can’t complain. We worked hard on it all night and had a fast car – had a car that I think if it would’ve stayed green, maybe we could have contended.”

Earlier in the weekend, Denny Hamlin earned his third pole position of the season and he led 11 laps before finishing 10th.

The three drivers, along with Martin Truex Jr. are already locked into the Cup Series playoffs as the series heads to Indiana for the regular season finale. Busch, the 2015 series champion, leads the regular season by 39 points with one race remaining and he and Truex sit second and third in the playoff standings based on wins this year.

In NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) action, Hamlin made his sole start of the season and finished fourth as the highest-finishing Camry driver in Saturday’s race.

The NXS has two races remaining before their playoffs begin at Richmond Raceway later this month. Christopher Bell and Brandon Jones have already locked themselves into the post-season title hunt.

The race weekend was swept by Brad Keselowski.


Camry driver J.R. Todd won the Funny Car finals on Monday – his second consecutive U.S. Nationals title at Lucas Oil Raceway in Indianapolis.

“I’m just happy to get a win here,” Todd said. “The Funny Car division is so tough out here. We came out really strong this spring, then really fell off in the summer. Before this race, we made some pretty big changes going into the Indy test - in some ways going back to the old ways of running the DHL Toyota Camry.”

In Top Fuel, Doug Kalitta fell just 0.006 short of making it a Kalitta Motorsports/Toyota sweep as he advanced to his fifth final round of the season. Terry McMillen was the winner.

Indianapolis concluded the NHRA regular season as the Countdown to the Championship begins and four Toyota drivers will compete for the series title. Kalitta and Antron Brown will compete in Top Fuel, while Todd and Shawn Langdon will vie for the Funny Car title.


CJ Greaves drove his Toyota Tundra Pro-4 to victories on Friday and Saturday to capture the first Lucas Oil Midwest Short Course League title in off-road competition. Tundras won all seven points races on the schedule.

“Man, it was a crazy season,” said Greaves. “We had all kinds of ups and downs, we just kept our heads down and digging to get the truck better and better each week.”


Toyota driver Logan Seavey mastered the dirt track of DuQuoin State Fairgrounds to claim his first-career ARCA Racing Series victory in only his second series start on Monday.

Seavey started fourth and stayed within the top-10 most of the race until taking the lead on lap 66 (of 100) and never relinquished it to collect his first stock car victory.


Toyota drivers swept the weekend’s POWRi National Midget League events at Missouri’s Lake Ozark Speedway with Seavey winning Saturday night and POWRi point leader Tucker Klaasmeyer on Sunday.


The Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series closes out the regular season at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on September 9 at 2 p.m. ET on NBCSN. NASCAR Xfinity Series also competes at Indy on September 8 at 3 p.m. ET on NBCSN.

USAC will host a special event at the Dirt Track at Indianapolis Motor Speedway on September 5-6, which will be broadcast on September 7 at 6 p.m. ET on NBCSN.

ARCA will also race in Indy this week, at Lucas Oil Raceway on September 7 at 9 p.m. ET on MAVTV.

The Office of Transformation and Innovation will co-facilitate the design of the school in collaboration with School Leadership.
­­­­
The collaboration will also bring together nonprofits, including groups already working with Dallas ISD through the SMU Simmons School program,
, as well as Toyota Motor North America and Toyota Financial Services’ partners to address community issues like literacy, nutrition, transportation and after–school care –  each vital to creating successful outcomes for the community.

“Collectively, our goal is to create a brighter future for students, help families become more resilient, and create a community and school model that can be replicated,” said Mike Goss, president of Toyota USA Foundation. “We want to help increase access to opportunity, connecting students to the millions of STEM jobs that exist today, and the many more that will be created as industry advances.”

This partnership developed as a result of numerous requests from the community for STEM offerings within the Pinkston High School feeder pattern.

“This partnership advances our efforts currently underway in west Dallas, with a holistic approach that lifts the community and provides opportunity for students,” said SMU President R. Gerald Turner.  “Evidence-based education is the foundation for everything we do in the Simmons School, and we look forward to the opportunity to provide resources and research that underscore the success of the school.”

Following an inclusive planning phase, the next two academic years will focus on curriculum and professional development for faculty.

“Everything is still on the table, including decisions about curricula and which wrap-around services will be provided through the school by community partners,” said SMU Simmons School Dean Stephanie L. Knight. “This announcement is meant to let all the stakeholders, parents included, know that we want their input at every level as we move forward.”

The school will begin a phased opening beginning fall 2021.

NASCAR Regular Season Champ Crowned,"September 11, 2018","
A rain-soaked Indianapolis – which pushed the NASCAR races to a Monday double-header – couldn’t dampen the racing-action at the Brickyard which delivered a Toyota-powered Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (MENCS) regular season champion and a historic victory in the first-ever dirt USAC race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway.


Camry driver Kyle Busch was crowned the 2018 MENCS regular season champion after leading 27 laps (of 160) at Indy – where he finished eighth in Monday’s rain-delayed race.

En route to the regular season title, Busch claimed six victories and 17 top-five finishes in the season’s first 26 races. He enters the Cup Playoffs tied for the points lead with Kevin Harvick, and 15 points ahead of Toyota teammate and third-place Martin Truex Jr.

“They give away a trophy and we were able to go out and get it,” Busch said of the regular season title. “Everybody on this team, they work so hard all year long and to get us to where we’re at here today, it was certainly hard fought. Overall it’s pretty good to be in this spot with having those extra bonus points and having some new hardware to go home with us.”

Busch’s Joe Gibbs Racing teammates Erik Jones (second) and Denny Hamlin (third) tried to hold off race-winner Brad Keselowski but settled for their career-best finishes at the 2.5-mile race track. For Hamlin, it was the third time he collected a third-place finish at the Brickyard in 13 track Cup starts.

Truex (third), Jones (10th) and Hamlin (13th) will accompany Busch in the Cup Playoffs, which are set to begin this weekend at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.

In Monday’s rain-delayed NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) race at Indy, Toyota drivers Christopher Bell (seventh) and Brandon Jones (10th) earned top-10 finishes behind Xfinity race winner Justin Allgaier.

The series also heads to Vegas later this week to close out their regular season where Toyota drivers Bell and B. Jones are locked into the NXS Playoffs, which begin in two weeks at Richmond Raceway.


Brady Bacon led the final nine laps and held off fellow Toyota driver Chad Boat to win the USAC National Midget series’ inaugural feature race at the Dirt Track at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in an event that included more than 100 cars.

Toyota-powered entries have now won 33 national midget features in 2018, with 14 different drivers scoring at least one win.

"Toyota Drivers Take NHRA, NASCAR Point Leads","September 17, 2018","
Championship pursuits began over the weekend in NHRA and NASCAR where Toyota drivers J.R. Todd – who won in his Camry Funny Car – and Martin Truex Jr. now lead their respective series standings. Toyota drivers also won ARCA and POWRi races to give Toyota three victories in three different states over the weekend. Additionally, top-five finishes by Fredric Aasbø and Ryan Tuerck helped Toyota unofficially clinch the Formula DRIFT manufacturer’s title.


As the highest-finishing Camry driver, Martin Truex Jr. earned a third-place result in Sunday’s Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series (MENCS) race at Las Vegas Motor Speedway, which was won by Brad Keselowski. Kyle Busch (seventh) rebounded from early trouble to earn his 22nd top-10 of the season. Toyota playoff drivers Denny Hamlin and Erik Jones were involved in incidents, and finished 32nd and 40th, respectively.

“All in all it was a great day for everybody on the Bass Pro/5-hour ENERGY Camry and all the guys did a phenomenal job this weekend,” said Truex. “Thanks to all the guys back in Denver at the shop, it’s pretty cool to see the effort going into these last 10 – we’re going to get after them. We had a winning car, just didn’t work out for us today. Really proud of the effort.”

The NASCAR Xfinity Series (NXS) closed out their regular season at Las Vegas on Saturday where Camry driver Christopher Bell (fourth) was the top-finishing Toyota driver. Ryan Preece (sixth) and Brandon Jones (seventh) also earned top-10 finishes in a race won by Ross Chastain. Bell and Jones will compete in the NXS playoffs set to begin Friday at Richmond Raceway.

“We won at Richmond in the spring,” said Bell as the series heads into the playoffs. “I think we’ll be in really good shape. This team does a great job at building really fast cars. For the most part, we always contend for the wins. I am really happy about that.”

Toyota drivers earned two top-10 finishes in Friday’s NASCAR Camping World Truck Series (NCWTS) race at Las Vegas with Austin Theriault (eighth) and Chris Eggleston (10th), behind NCWTS race winner Grant Enfinger.

Toyota driver Hailie Deegan won the pole position – the first female to do so in the NASCAR K&N Pro Series – and won her heat race in Thursday’s K&N West event at the Dirt Track at Las Vegas. However in the feature she couldn’t hold off race winner Sheldon Creed to equal her career-best runner-up result.


J.R. Todd drove his Toyota Camry Funny Car to victory in Sunday’s NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series event at Pennsylvania’s Maple Grove Raceway, taking championship points lead after the first round of the NHRA Countdown to the Championship playoffs.

""It's awesome to keep the momentum going, but we still have a long road ahead of us,” said Todd, who has now won two straight Funny Car events and four overall this season. “These DHL/Wix Filter Toyota guys know how to win. A lot of them were here when Del Worsham won the title in 2015. It was nice to be able to come out of here with a win.”

This was also a milestone victory for Kalitta Motorsports – their 100th.

In Top Fuel, Antron Brown advanced to the semi-finals to move up to fifth in the point standings.

"Hands-On Approach Brings Thousands Outdoors to Restore, Refurbish, Rehabilitate","September 20, 2018","
With a focus on projects in nine states 20 years ago, volunteers set out to unify their work to restore public lands, parks, forests and beaches under the newly organized
(NPLD). That year, more than 1,500 Toyota team members, families and friends worked together to clean the waters of the Potomac River in Washington, D.C. and plant greenery at the National Wildlife Refuge in Seal Beach, California.

Toyota’s commitment to expanding a lasting impact on the environment has grown with the company’s presence in the U.S. This year, Toyota has 50 projects planned across 20 states and Puerto Rico, and expects more than 3,000 team members to get outside this weekend and volunteer. Additionally, Toyota provides the support for nearly 2,000 additional community projects across the nation.

“Our core value of environmental sustainability is reflected in our long-term commitment to National Public Lands Day,” said Kevin Butt, regional environmental director, Toyota. “We have seen our team members take ownership of this annual event, and connect with their local communities in lasting ways. It is something we have seen grow alongside our company’s presence in the U.S.”

Toyota’s national partnership with NPLD encompasses projects team members have found in their communities to celebrate this year’s theme of “restoration and resilience.” Over the past 20 years, Toyota has contributed more than $9 million to NPLD in donations, grants, and volunteer equivalent hours.


Toyota’s team members have taken ownership of their project sites, with many having personal connections to the parks.

When a large section of Aaron Wright’s favorite recreational area had been closed for an extended period of time, he saw an opportunity in NPLD to find out why. That place was the
in Denton, Texas. “The site is very personal because my wife and I used to go kayaking there,” said Wright. “I didn’t even know why we couldn’t use the area anymore.”

After heavy rains in 2015, the Greenbelt Corridor, a 20-mile multi-use trail system (12 miles for equestrian and 10 for hike and bike use), was closed from the US 380 access point up to 3 miles north. Initially set to last two weeks, the closure has been in effect for over two years. “The area lies in a flood plain,” said Wright. “There was so much impact that the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department is putting out a bid to redo the parking area at trailheads, plus much of the trails were washed away.”


About 200 miles south, water was also the cause of a closure of more than 113,000 acres of land and water Hurricane Harvey blew through seven counties in southeast Texas. The
(BITH) near Beaumont, Texas, is a heavily forested area encompassing over 29 counties and more than 3.35 million acres to protect the many plant and animal species within.

On September 22, nearly 200 volunteers from Gulf States Toyota, St. Bernard Project, AmeriCorps and other community organizations will join the nation’s largest single-day volunteer effort.

“This event gives us a chance to remind people that these public lands are theirs to enjoy and care for,” said Karen Matsuyama, community connections analyst, Toyota. “We see friends, families and colleagues come together and appreciate our national parks while teaching children at a young age to give back and be outdoors.”

Over the past year, park officials and volunteers have mounted a steady clean-up effort, but some areas still need help.National Park Service plans to mobilize volunteer support during NPLD 2018 to restore areas that have remaining storm damage and debris. To help with these efforts, Toyota and NEEF will provide a $20,000 grant to support a local nonprofit to continue the restoration work started on Saturday.


2018 marks the 20th year of partnership between Toyota and NEEF's National Public Lands Day. Toyota encourages its employees to get involved in NPLD activities throughout the nation by helping to care for parks, forests, rivers, beaches, shorelines, and other public lands.

Toyota has 50 sites throughout the country where team members volunteer from Puerto Rico to California and everywhere in between. Some of this year’s Toyota-led projects include:


- At this annual event, volunteers will be cutting and hauling non-native brush; there will also be native seed collection in which the seed that is collected will be planted in area that brush has been cleared.


– About 200 Toyota volunteers will provide needed care for the White Point Education & Nature Preserve Center by planting native shrubs, removing invasive weeds, watering native plants, grooming trails and more. Efforts will help restore this habitat for wildlife as well as create a beautiful place for the community to enjoy.


– Nearly 170 Toyota volunteers will clean up 11 coastal and nature areas including the Deerfield Beach, Pompano Beach, Lauderdale-by-the-Sea, Oakland Park Boulevard, Hugh Taylor Birch State Park, Ft. Lauderdale Beach, Dania Beach, Von D. Mizell & Eula Johnson, Smallwood Park and Red Reef Park near Palm Beach.


Volunteers will plant 75 iris bulbs, level monuments that have deteriorated or been vandalized, repair a stone fence along US 25, gather/repair capstones around koi pond, trim trees and paint bridges.


– More than 125 volunteers will participate in a half-day clean-up at Smithville Lake to clear trains and the Sailboat Cove for outdoor recreational use.


- Toyota volunteers will return to Vinita Park once again this year to assist with cleaning up walking trails, trash pickup, and beautifying the park.


Projects at Tombigbee State Park will consist of improving/updating the disc golf course, Pavilion #2 upgrades, installation of approximately 2,400 feet of split rail fence and design and installation of landscape materials at front entrance and park office. This is the fourth year of a five-year, $250,000 commitment to restore the park.


Volunteers will help Leslie Science & Nature Center clean up their Nature Playscape area, pulling invasive species, spreading woodchips and cleaning up the surrounding trails. The Nature Playscape began with Toyota volunteers and Eagle Scouts in 2017, and has become a place for programs, camps and the general public to learn about our natural world.


In addition to a $50,000 donation to a new innovative and adaptive playground in the community, volunteers will install a wheelchair accessible swing for the future site. The park supports multi-sensory play for children with special needs.


– Volunteers will restore and beautify this metro marine park by removing invasive species, trimming vegetation for safe and easy access (all of which will go to the Oregon Zoo for the elephants, bears and rhinos to eat!), design/plant/care for bioswales and medians for better water filtering, clean/paint/maintain facility resources, restore habitat for native wildlife, and learn about the history of the area.

With Toyota team members committed to both restoring and reclaiming public lands for the local community, the organization continues to work toward preserving the biodiversity of the surrounding communities. Toyota’s
specifically calls for all Toyota sites to establish a future society in harmony with nature. This includes conserving forests and other rich natural systems in the region. Through everyday operational initiatives to have zero-landfill manufacturing sites and programs like NPLD, team members play a key role to actively enhance the natural balance of plants, animals and ecosystems in North America.

National Public Lands Day celebrates the connection between people and their environment by inviting people to get outside spend the day caring for and enjoying the outdoors. NEEF partners with local organizations across the nation to connect people of all ages and abilities with public lands for recreation, hands-on learning, and community-building.
